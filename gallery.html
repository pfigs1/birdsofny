        <h5>American Oystercatcher</h5>
        <p>A large, boldly patterned bird, the American Oystercatcher is conspicuous along ocean shores and salt marshes. True to its name, it is specialized in feeding on bivalves (oysters, clams, and mussels) and uses its brightly colored bill to get at
          them.</p>

        <h5>Painted Bunting</h5>
        <p>The Painted Bunting are known for the blues, reds, yellows and green that adorn their males and the bright green on the females and immatures. Including this tropical finch on a site for New York City Birds is a bit of a red herring; the painting bunting is most commonly found in South and South Central US and Central America. In December of 2015, a painted bunting became a local celebrity for his stay in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park; he brought his fans a splash of color, a welcome reprieve in the midst of a cold and gray winter. It is likely that the painted bunting got blown off course and is unlikely to return anytime soon.

        <h5>Red Tailed Hawk</h5>
        <p>Red-tailed Hawks are large hawks with typical Buteo proportions: very broad, rounded wings and a short, wide tail. This is probably the most common hawk in North America. If you’ve got sharp eyes you’ll see several individuals on almost any long
          car ride, anywhere.</p>

        <h5>Canada Goose</h5>
        <p>Canada Geese are big waterbirds with a long neck, large body, large webbed feet, and wide, flat bill. Canada Geese have a black head with white cheeks and chinstrap, black neck, tan breast, and brown back.</p>

        <h5>Osprey</h5>
        <p>Ospreys are very large, distinctively shaped hawks. Despite their size, their bodies are slender, with long, narrow wings and long legs. Ospreys fly with a marked kink in their wings, making an M-shape when seen from below. Unique among North
          American raptors for its diet of live fish and ability to dive into water to catch them, Ospreys are common sights soaring over shorelines, patrolling waterways, and standing on their huge stick nests, white heads gleaming.</p>

        <img src="images/egret.jpg">
        <h5>Egret</h5>
        <p>Great Egrets are tall, long-legged wading birds with long, S-curved necks and long, dagger-like bills. In flight, the long neck is tucked in and the legs extend far beyond the tip of the short tail. All feathers on Great Egrets are white. Their
          bills are yellowish-orange, and the legs black.</p>

      <div class="photo">
        <img src="images/blueheron.jpg">
        <h5>Blue Heron</h5>
        <p>These are the largest of the North American herons with long legs, a sinuous neck, and thick, daggerlike bill. The head, chest, and wing plumes give a shaggy appearance. In flight, the Great Blue Heron curls its neck into a tight “S” shape; its wings are broad and rounded and its legs trail beyond the tail.</p>

      <div class="photo">
        <img src="images/sparrow.jpg">
        <h5>House Sparrow</h5>
        <p>House Sparrows are chunkier, fuller in the chest, with a larger, rounded head, shorter tail, and stouter bill than most American sparrows. They have lived around humans for centuries. Look for them on city streets, taking handouts in parks and zoos, or cheeping from a perch on your roof or trees in your yard. </p>

      <div class="photo">
        <img src="images/seagull.jpg">
        <h5>Seagull</h5>
        <p>Seagulls have hefty bills and robust bodies. In flight, they look barrel-chested and broad-winged compared to smaller species such as Ring-billed Gulls.Look for them in winter along coasts and near large reservoirs, lakes, and major rivers.</p>

      <div class="photo">
        <img src="images/robin.jpg">
        <p>Robins are fairly large songbirds with a large, round body, long legs, and fairly long tail. They are industrious and authoritarian birds that bound across lawns or stand erect, beak tilted upward, to survey their environs. When alighting they habitually flick their tails downward several times.</p>

        <img src="images/starling.jpg">
        <h5>European Starling</h5>
        <p>European Starlings hold the distinction of being North America’s most populous songbirds. The entire population on this continent originate from 100 birds that were brought over and released in Central Park in the 1890s. This migration was an effort by Shakespeare enthusiasts who wanted all the birds ever mentioned in his work to have a home in the US. Today their population is estimated to be 200 million. The European Starlings are strong fliers and can hit speeds up to 48 mph. Starlings are skilled impersonators; they can imitate the calls of up to 20 different species. </p>

        <img src="images/pigeon.jpg">
        <h5> Rock Pigeon</h5>
        <p>These city dwellers are as synonymous with NYC as bagels and yellow taxis. They build their nests on window sills and air conditioners and sustain themselves on discarded food and birdseed. What you may not know is that rock pigeons are amazing navigators and can find their way home even from unknown locations. They do this with sound, smell, the position of the sun and a unique ability to sense the earth’s magnetic fields. In WWI and WWII, Rock pigeons were messengers for the US Army SIgnal Corps, providing vital strategic information.

        <img src="images/falcon.jpg">
        <h5>Peregrine Falcon</h5>
        <p>Peregrine Falcons are powerful hunters that take advantage of the height of New York City’s skyscrapers to perch and seek prey below. Once the prey is spotted- often the rock pigeon- the Peregrine Falcon swoops down at speeds up to 69 mph in direct pursuit. Average traveling speed for these city birds ranges from 25-24 mph. The populations of these hunters was nearly wiped out in Eastern North America due to pesticide poisoning; with great recovery efforts,  the Peregrine Falcon has made an incredible comeback. Today, the Peregrine Falcon is widespread and can be found on all continents except Antarctica.  </p>

        <img src= "images/cormorant.jpg">
        <h5>Double-crested Cormorant</h5>
        <p>The Double-crested Cormorant can be found in New York City harbors and bays. These birds are excellent swimmers and skilled underwater hunters. It helps that they have less preening oil than other water-loving birds; this allows them to swim and hunt with speed and accuracy. It does present a problem for soaked feathers. Without the preen oil, the feathers can’t shed water like ducks do. Instead, they spend much of their day posing on docks with their wings spread out, drying in the sun. </p>
